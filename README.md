# Rocket
This is a GPS Tracked Rocket with a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400). To do the initial setup of the pi, follow the instructions found in the [Pi folder](https://github.com/DonBower/rocket/tree/master/Pi)

Julian will be enrolled once again in his school's science fair, so this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for him, even though the science fair is not until later in the calendar year.

## Objectives:
Measure the trajectory of a rocket when launched from different angles.

1. Location. Precise location is always imperative. So we will use [Adafruit's Ultimate GPS Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746). The Setup for this device is described in the [GPS Folder](https://github.com/DonBower/rocket/tree/master/GPS)
